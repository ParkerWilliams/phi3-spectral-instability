# Session Log

Rolling state summary so work survives session/crash loss (CLAUDE.md convention).
Newest entry on top. Keep entries short: what's true now, what's next, gotchas.

## 2026-06-02 — Feature 001 wrapped (Phase 7 polish; SC-004 deferred)

Per Parker: defer SC-004 (skip throwaway manual waypointing) and close out 001.
Phase 7 polish done (T042–T045): `docs/bot-stats.md` (bot_accuracy **WIRED**,
others recorded-only, `sim_*` cvars), `docs/telemetry.md` (G1/G2 conformance,
schema_version 1), `docs/design.md` §11 (sampling, RNG-seed open Qs),
`sims/README.md` (build-local/`uv` workflow). Harness still green (pytest 39/39,
ruff + mypy clean).

**Feature 001 code is complete (US1–US4).** The only remaining items all need a
running agent that actually fights: SC-004 live proof, T046 end-to-end, T006
(LibreQuake licensing), and the CI workflow's first real run. All of those are
gated on the agent reaching combat → **next feature = automatic navigation**
(`docs/design.md` §3). Hand-waypointing intentionally skipped as throwaway.

## 2026-06-02 — Design decision: automatic navigation as a progression axis

Parker set direction: maps will be **procedurally generated**, so navigation
**must be automatic** (hand-waypointing can't scale); nav competence **improves
over progression** (the core idle "friend getting better" fantasy); and imperfect
/ "silly" pathing is **acceptable** (idle game). Captured in `docs/design.md` §3
(new "Navigation & traversal"), §6 (procedural maps), §7 + §11 (open: generation
mechanism), glossary; mirrored in `CLAUDE.md`. Hand-recorded `.way` files
(`docs/waypointing.md`) are now explicitly **temporary scaffolding** to unblock
SC-004 on one fixed map — not the shipping approach. Mechanism (FrikBot
`DynamicWaypoint` auto-record pass vs BSP-derived nav-mesh vs learned) is a future
ADR. Doesn't change feature 001; it reframes the waypointing detour as a bootstrap.

## 2026-06-02 — US4 implemented + SC-004 blocked on no-combat

**Status: feature `001-headless-sim-telemetry` — US4 (Phase 6, smoke CI gate) done.
All four user stories implemented. One open issue: SC-004 not live-proven yet.**

- ✅ **US4 (verified):** `configs/smoke.toml` (15 s), `smoke` subcommand sharing
  the `run` pipeline (`_run_to_summary`) with a strict `smoke_chain_healthy` gate
  (bracketed stream + non-error → exit 0, else non-zero + diagnostic).
  `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: `harness` (ruff/mypy/pytest) + `smoke` (build +
  `just sim-smoke`). `uv run pytest` **39/39**, ruff + mypy clean. CI workflow
  itself is first-run-pending (smoke job must be GH-hosted; droplet can't build).

- ⚠️ **SC-004 BLOCKED (not a code defect):** ran `--bot.bot_accuracy 0.1` vs `0.9`
  ×3 on `lq_e1m1` → **all runs `shots_fired: 0`, `accuracy: 0.0`**. The bot never
  enters combat: no waypoints for `lq_*` maps → it wanders aimlessly and never
  reaches/fights monsters, so the `bot_accuracy`→aim wiring (T037) has nothing to
  act on. The wiring is in and correct; proving it needs actual combat. Options:
  (a) deathmatch with 2 bots on `lqdm*` so they hunt each other, (b) waypoints for
  a LibreQuake map, (c) a small combat arena. This is the bot-navigation gap, a
  known future-work dependency — same root as the `couldn't exec *.way` note.

**Decision (Parker):** author waypoints (option b) to make the single agent
engage. Workflow written up in **`docs/waypointing.md`** — build the GL client
(needs audio dev libs), record a `.way` for `lq_e1m1` via FrikBot's editor
(`impulse 104`, Dynamic Mode), drop it at `quakec/maps/lq_e1m1.way` (both GL
client + sim `exec` it), then the SC-004 0.1-vs-0.9 check works. Hands-on local
work (needs a display / WSLg). Then Phase 7 polish; T006 licensing + CI first-run
still open.

## 2026-06-02 — US3 implemented (config tuning + bot_accuracy aim)

**Status: feature `001-headless-sim-telemetry` — US3 (Phase 5, per-run cvar config).**

The harness is now a tuning tool: `bot_*` overrides are clamped, recorded with a
stable `config_hash`, and `bot_accuracy` is wired into FrikBot aim.

- ✅ **Harness (verified):** `--bot.<name> VAL`/`=VAL` CLI extraction (T034) →
  clamped into `bot_config`; bool-string coercion + `BotInput` type. `test_clamp.py`
  (T038): clamp ranges, hash equal/differ, unknown-stat KeyError. T035/T036 were
  already done in US1. `uv run pytest` **35/35**, ruff + mypy clean.
- 📝 **QuakeC (compile-pending):** T037 — `bot_accuracy` aim error in
  `frikbot/bot_ai.qc` `bot_angle_set`: `err=(1-acc)*15°` random offset on the
  enemy-aim `b_angle`. Higher accuracy → tighter aim → higher `stats.accuracy`
  (SC-004). Unset cvar → default 0.3. The 15° max is tunable.
- **Open earlier loop:** US2 live re-run (post the parser/level_start fix) wasn't
  pasted back — worth confirming `level_start` now appears + events reconcile.

**Next (local):** rebuild, then SC-004 check — `--bot.bot_accuracy 0.1` vs `0.9`
on a monster-bearing map, average `stats.accuracy` over a few runs. Then US4
(`smoke` subcommand + CI gate, T039-T041).

## 2026-06-02 — US2 implemented (Python verified, QuakeC compile-pending)

**Status: feature `001-headless-sim-telemetry` — US2 (Phase 4, per-event stream).**

The per-event JSONL stream + reconciled stats. Harness side fully done & verified;
QuakeC emits authored, awaiting a local `just build-quakec` + `just sim`.

- ✅ **Harness (verified, TDD):** `aggregate()` counts kill/death/shot/hit/pickup/
  secret → kills/deaths/damage_dealt/accuracy/weapon_usage/deaths_by_cause;
  `writer.write_events`/`validate_event` write+validate `*.events.jsonl`;
  `stream_invariant_ok` + harness wiring. New tests `test_reconcile.py` (SC-003)
  and events-schema cases in `test_schema.py` (SC-002). `uv run pytest` 23/23,
  ruff + mypy clean. `damage_taken` stays 0 (G1); `secrets_total` from level_start (G2).
- 📝 **QuakeC (compile-pending):** `telemetry.qc` gameplay emitters + hooks in
  combat.qc (kill + outgoing-damage accumulator), weapons.qc (W_Attack shot/hit
  window), client.qc (death), triggers.qc (secret), items.qc (7 pickups). Verified
  every referenced symbol exists; can't compile on droplet.
- ⚠️ **shot/hit scoping:** one shot + at most one hit per trigger-pull. Only
  hitscan (shotgun/super-shotgun) damage that lands synchronously is counted as a
  hit; projectile/animation-frame weapons record the shot but not the hit this
  slice (under-count, never over-count). Full attribution = follow-up.

**Next:** local `just build-quakec` → `just sim` on a map with monsters/items,
then `jq` the `*.events.jsonl` to confirm kill/shot/hit/pickup events reconcile
with the summary. After that: US3 (clamped cvars + `bot_accuracy` wiring).

## 2026-06-02 — US1 verified live end-to-end 🎯

**Status: feature `001-headless-sim-telemetry` — US1 (Phase 3 / MVP) DONE & verified live.**

A headless `fteqw-sv` run on a LibreQuake map autostarts the FrikBot agent, emits
`@EVT|...` telemetry to stdout, and the Python harness writes one schema-valid
`*.summary.json` (`outcome: timeout`, exit 0). First end-to-end proof of the chain.

### What happened this session
- Recovered from a crash with no prior session log. Found state: US1 committed
  (8ee15dd) but compile-UNVERIFIED.
- Branch `001-headless-sim-telemetry` existed only on the droplet → pushed to
  origin. Droplet has no GitHub SSH key; pushed via `gh` HTTPS (`gh auth setup-git`).
- Fixed two FrikBot single-pass compile errors (commit d58c326): forward-declare
  `map_dm{1..6}` in `frikbot/bot.qc`; call `checkextension` (defs.qc) instead of
  the later-declared `frik_checkextension` in `frikbot/bot_ed.qc`.
- First local build (Parker, WSL Ubuntu): `just build-sim` green — `fteqw-sv`,
  `fteqcc`, `progs.dat` (27 benign warnings), `uv sync`. Server build needs NO
  audio libs (opus/speex/vorbis are client-only).
- Vendored LibreQuake v0.09-beta release paks (`mod.zip` → `id1/pak0.pak`,
  `pak1.pak`); default map `lq_e1m1`.
- Verified telemetry reaches stdout (the big unknown): `@EVT|0|level_start|...`
  then `@EVT|15.09|level_end|outcome=timeout|...`. `just sim` → schema-valid summary.
- Cleanups: launcher sets `sv_public 0` and finds the binary in `release/`;
  `id1/` gitignored; `docs/licenses.md` updated (see license caveat below).

### Resume / next
- **US2 (Phase 4):** QuakeC gameplay emits (kill/death/shot/hit/pickup/secret) +
  harness aggregation + JSONL stream + reconciliation test (T024–T033).
- **T006 proper:** resolve LibreQuake licensing (below) + decide final vendoring
  (release paks vs source submodule). For US2 secret tests pick a map WITH a
  `trigger_secret` — `lq_e1m1` has none.
- FrikBot has no waypoints for `lq_*` maps (`couldn't exec maps/lq_e1m1.way`) so
  the bot wanders → timeout. Real navigation is later work.

### Gotchas / environment
- **Build locally, never on the droplet** (~1 GB RAM, no swap — OOMs, would kill
  the shared tmux). Droplet may *run* sims once binaries exist; it can edit/commit.
- `make sv-rel` writes `engine/engine/release/fteqw-sv`; launcher now searches
  there (no symlink needed).
- **LibreQuake license is UNRESOLVED** — repo says "art under BSD" but ships no
  LICENSE file (`NOASSERTION`). `docs/licenses.md` flags it; clear before release.
- Push from the droplet: `gh auth setup-git`, then push the HTTPS URL (no SSH key).
